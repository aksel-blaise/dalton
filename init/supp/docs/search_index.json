Selden, Jr.1 2020-08-30 Preface Reproducibility—the ability to recompute results—and replicability—the chances other experimenters will achieve a consistent result—are two foundational characteristics of successful scientific research (Leek and Peng 2015). This volume is written in Markdown, and all files needed to reproduce it are included in the GitHub repository. The reproducible nature of this undertaking provides a means for others to critically assess and evaluate the various analytical components (Gray and Marwick 2019; Peng 2011; Gandrud 2014), which is a necessary requirement for the production of reliable knowledge. Reproducibility projects in psychology and cancer biology are impacting current research practices across all domains. Examples of reproducible research are becoming more abundant in archaeology (Marwick 2016; Ivanovaitė et al. 2020; Selden Jr., Dockall, and Dubied 2020), and the next generation of archaeologists are learning those tools and methods needed to reproduce and/or replicate research results (Marwick et al. 2019). Reproducible and replicable research work flows are often employed at the highest levels of humanities-based inquiries to mitigate concern or doubt regarding proper execution, and is of particular import should the results have—explicitly or implicitly—a major impact on scientific progress (Peels and Bouter 2018). Components of the undertaking presented in this volume are novel, and this basic research endeavour is rooted in archaeological epistemology. Sharing data is not enough, and if investigators share only data absent their analysis code, that places a substantive burden on those who may seek to build upon or replicate their work in the future. In this instance, the choice to pursue a replicable work flow occurs based on the simple fact that this work is foundational, and meant to begin a meaningful discussion related to projectile morphology. As an exploratory research endeavour, this study was not preregistered. 0.1 Acknowledgments This volume enlists a variety of tools from the Open Review Toolkit, as well as the code provided for the bookdown package. I extend my gratitude to all who contribute comments and constructive criticisms throughout the development and maturation of this project. This document will remain in open review until the article is published. 0.2 Funding Components of this analytical work flow were developed and funded by a Preservation Technology and Training grant (P14AP00138) to the author from the National Center for Preservation Technology and Training (NCPTT), and funding for this project was provided by grants to the RZS from the National Forests and Grasslands in Texas (15-PA-11081300-033) and the United States Forest Service (20-PA-11081300-074).

The goals of this study differ; however, the mechanics of the landmarking protocol are similar, and follow components of Dalton projectile morphology identified in previous studies (refs?). Geomagic Design X (Build Version 2020.0.1 [Build Number: 30]) was used to generate a spline around the periphery of each biface, and to populate the landmarks and equidistant semilandmarks in a replicable manner using a suite of mathematically-defined criteria. knitr::include_graphics(&#39;images/dalton.png&#39;) Figure 1.1: Dalton point KeilMangold13. The goal of this effort was to increase both the precision and rigour of the study by including the z-dimension to capture morphological characteristics associated with axial twisting introduced through the general practices of knapping and beveling. While true that some landmarking protocols can be—and often are—recycled as new specimens are added, this particular research programme endeavours to achieve ever-greater accuracy and precision in each analytical iteration. This landmarking protocol was developed prior to running auto3dgm, and details the procedure for applying landmarks and equidistant semilandmarks; however, it may not reflect their actual placement on this specimen. 1.1 Generating the spline This effort enlists a spline extracted from the surface geometry of the mesh using the extract contour curves command, which is used to detect and extract 3D contour curves from high-curvature areas of the mesh. In reverse-engineering, extract contour curves is regularly employed as the first step in building a patch network that is used to create a surface. The extracted feature curve is rendered as a spline, and follows the highest curvature contours around the periphery of the lateral and basal edges, following the highly variable sinuous edge morphology around the entirety of the projectile. The remainder of the landmarking protocol is based upon this spline, which was subsequently split at six mathematically-defined locations. knitr::include_graphics(&#39;images/extractspline.png&#39;) Figure 1.2: Spline extracted along the highest contours of the Dalton point. 1.2 Splitting the spline A few definitions are warranted before proceeding. Reference geometries are used in the assistance of creating other features. These include basic geometric entities, such as planes, vectors, coordinates, points, and polygons. A reference point is a virtual point and is used to mark a specific position on a model or in 3D space. A reference plane is a virtual plane that has a normal direction and an infinite size. A reference plane is not a surface body, and is used to create other features. The characteristic points and tangents developed for this landmarking protocol were inspired by the work of Birkhoff (1933), which has been gainfully employed within the context of both ceramic (Selden Jr. 2018a, 2018b, 2019, 2020) and lithic analyses (Selden Jr., Dockall, and Shafer 2018; Selden Jr., Dockall, and Dubied 2020). The first landmark (LM1) is placed at the horizontal tangent on the tip of each Dalton point. The second through fifth splits (LM2 - LM5) occur at points of highest curvature, where LM2 is always placed on the right side of the projectile when oriented in 3D space following the alignment output of auto3dgm. To place the final landmark (LM6), a linear measurement was used to project a reference point equidistant between LM2 and LM3. The location of that point was leveraged in placing the reference plane used to cut the spline at the location of LM6. 1.3 Spline split at location of LM1 The horizontal tangent is calculated by drawing a horizontal line above the tip of the biface using the tangent as a common constraint, and the horizontal as the independent constraint. To split the 3D spline at the location of the horizontal tangent, a reference point was inserted at the location of the tangent in the sketch (light blue point; below, left), followed by a reference plane (in white; below, left and right) using the pick point and normal axis function where the reference point (h-tangent) was used as the pick point, and the Right plane as the normal axis (below, left). The spline was then cut at the location where the reference plane intersected with the spline (below image, right). knitr::include_graphics(&#39;images/lm1.png&#39;) Figure 1.3: Identify horizontal tangent, insert reference point and reference plane (left). Use reference plane to cut spline at the location of the horizontal tangent (right). 1.4 Spline split at locations of LM2 - LM3 The point of highest curvature on either side of the basal edge was calculated using the curvature function in the Accuracy Analyser. This function displays the curvature flow as a continuous colour plot across the area of the curve. In this instance, curvature is defined as the amount by which a geometric shape deviates from being flat or straight in the case of a line. The curvature is displayed in different colours according to the local radius, and is calculated in only one direction (U or V) along the curve. Using this tool, the two points of highest curvature were located between the basal and lateral edges on either side of each projectile where the local radius measure was largest. The alignment and orientation of each biface was dictated by the auto3dgm output, and the landmarking protocol follows the mesh orientation, where LM2 was always placed on the right side of the basal edge, and LM3 on the left. knitr::include_graphics(&#39;images/splinesplit1.png&#39;) Figure 1.4: Identify points of hightest curvature (light blue) at left/right intersection of lateral and basal edges. 1.5 Spline split at locations of LM4 - LM5 The point of highest curvature at the intersection of the blade and base was also calculated using the curvature function in the Accuracy Analyser. Using this tool, the two points of highest curvature were located between the blade and base on either side of each projectile where the local radius measure was largest. The alignment and orientation of each biface was dictated by the auto3dgm output, and the landmarking protocol follows the mesh orientation in that figure, where LM4 was always placed on the right side of the basal edge, and LM5 on the left. knitr::include_graphics(&#39;images/splinesplit2.png&#39;) Figure 1.5: Identify points of hightest curvature (light blue) at left/right intersection of blade and base. 1.6 Spline split at location of LM6 One additional landmark (LM6) was placed at the centre of the base. The location of this landmark was identified by calculating the linear distance between LM2 and LM3, and projecting a reference point (ctrl-div; below) equidistant between the two. A reference plane was added using the ctrl-div as the pick point, and the Right plane as the normal axis. The spline was then split at the intersection of the reference plane and the basal spline. knitr::include_graphics(&#39;images/lm6.png&#39;) Figure 1.6: Calculate linear distance between LM2 and LM3, insert reference plane coplanar to Right plane equidistant between LM2 and LM3, and use the reference plane to cut the spline. 1.7 Peripheral (plan view) spline Through the preceding protocol, the initial spline was split into six discrete splines. These splines articulate with components of projectile morphology that can be compartmentalised in the analyses. The primary analytical gain achieved through this exercise is the requisite foundation needed to carry out replicable analyses of Dalton point morphology in three dimensions, further increasing the precision of the geometric morphometric analysis. knitr::include_graphics(&#39;images/splinesplit-frbl.png&#39;) Figure 1.7: Result of spline splits include six discrete splines, each articulating with a region of analytical interest. 1.8 Landmark and semilandmark placement Landmarks 1 - 6 were placed at the location of each spline split (blue points, below). Equidistant semilandmarks were added to each of the four splines; 10 between LM1 and LM4, three between LM4 and LM2, three between LM2 and LM6, three between LM6 and LM3, three between LM3 and LM5, and 10 between LM5 and LM1. knitr::include_graphics(&#39;images/lmslm-all.png&#39;) Figure 1.8: Mesh with landmarks (blue) and equidistant semilandmarks (white) applied. The rigourous protocol used in the application of landmarks and semilandmarks aids in capturing morphological variation that articulates with differing patterns of reduction and axial twisting introduced by knappers through the general practice of knapping, retouch, and beveling. Thus, this constellation of landmarks and semilandmarks provides for greater precision in the geometric morphometric analysis, marking a substantive advancement in those analytical protocols used to achieve a more complete and holistic analysis of Dalton point morphology. 1.9 Acknowledgments I extend my gratitude to Christian S. Hoggard and David K. Thulman for their thoughtful comments and constructive criticisms on the draft of this landmarking protocol, which was originally developed for the study of Gahagan bifaces, and is extended here to an analysis of Dalton point morphology. This iteration of the landmarking protocol was developed using the digit3DLand package in R (code available in Github repository); however, the capacity to populate a replicable suite of reference geometry across the sample in Geomagic Design X made it a better option for the dynamic design process. Definitions of reference geometries and Design X features described in this protocol are paraphrased from the reference manual. References "],
["landmark-sampling-evaluation-curve-lm3d1.html", "Chapter 2 Landmark Sampling Evaluation Curve (LM3d1) 2.1 Landmark configuration 3d1", " Chapter 2 Landmark Sampling Evaluation Curve (LM3d1) The landmarking configuration designed to analyse the Dalton projectile points was further scrutinised using the Landmark Sampling Error Curve, or LaSEC, included in the LaMBDA package, as a means of assessing the fidelity of morphological characterisation by landmarks (Watanabe 2018). LaSEC conducts the following procedure (Watanabe 2018, 4–5): As is typical for extracting shape data, perform a generalized Procrustes alignment (gpagen function in the geomorph package) on a coordinate dataset (argument coord.data) in 2-D or 3-D (argument n.dim) and record the resulting shape coordinates and centroid size. Here, the shape coordinates are projected onto tangent space because pairwise distances among corresponding datasets later in the analysis are based on Euclidean distances and most shape analyses in the biological literature are conducted in tangent space instead of Procrustes shape space. Subsample the same three randomly selected landmarks from all specimens. The subsampling begins with a subset of three landmarks because a minimum of three landmarks is required to define shape. Then, generate shape and centroid size data with generalized Procrustes superimposition on the subsampled data. Perform an Ordinary Procrustes Alignment (protest function in the vegan R package) on the subsampled data to minimize the pairwise distances between corresponding landmarks in the parent data through translation, rotation, and scaling of data in full shape space. As stated above, note that this procedure is different from the typical implementation of Procrustes alignment on coordinate data in 2-D or 3-D space. The function then records the sum of these squared distances as measure of fit (PSS) between the relative locations of data points in the parent and subsampled datasets. Equivalent procedure is conducted on centroid size data. Sample one additional, randomly chosen landmark and repeat step 3 until the entire set of landmarks in the parent dataset is sampled. The completion of this step represents one iteration of subsampling. Repeat steps 2–5 for specified number of iterations (iter argument). Create sampling curves by plotting the trajectory of “fit” (1–PSS) against the number of landmarks sampled from each iteration for both shape and centroid size as gray lines. Then, plot the median fit value for each number of landmarks sampled on the same plot as a thick, dark line. Finally, output these sampling curves: LaSEC_SamplingCurve_Shape.pdf, LaSEC_SamplingCurve_Size.pdf. What follows is an assessment of the initial and current 3D landmark configurations used in the geometric morphometric study. This chapter concludes with the assessment of the landmark configuration for Dalton projectile points outlined in the previous chapter. 2.1 Landmark configuration 3d1 The initial 3D landmark configuration (3d1) was developed following Selden et al. (2020, Figure 8), and landmarks were applied subsequent to alignment in auto3dgm. This configuration of landmarks was originally developed using the R package digit3DLand, but later migrated to Geomagic Design X to leverage the benefits of reference geometry. In order to capitalise on this dynamic edge morphology associated with axial twisting, a new 3D landmarking protocol was developed for Gahagan bifaces, and was revised and repurposed for this analysis. That protocol includes X landmarks, and XX semilandmarks. Like the 3D landmarking protocol that preceded it, this 3D landmarking protocol was based upon the placement of specific elements of reference geometry. # load package

All landmarks (LMs) from LM3d1 were retained; however, all semilandmarks (SLMs) were discarded. The landmarking protocol that follows uses mesh topology paired with landmark coordinates as the foundation for a suite of reference geometry, which was combined with insight garnered from the application of LaSEC to LM3d1. The reference geometry was employed in constructing a novel landmarking protocol that builds directly upon LM3d1 to achieve a rigorous and replicable configuration of semilandmarks. The result is a landamrking protocol that provides for the improved characterisation of whole-object morphology, and that can be subset to explore morphological variation in plan, profile, and cross-section morphology. It also provides those data points needed to investigate questions of directional asymmetry, differences in front/back morphology, and morphological integration in blade/base morphology. knitr::include_graphics(&#39;images/landmarks.png&#39;) (#fig:lm3d2.landmarks)Landmarks from LM3d1 serve as the basis for LM3d2. Geomagic Design X (Build Version 2020.0.1 [Build Number: 30]) was used to generate a spline around the periphery of each biface, and to populate the landmarks and semilandmarks in a rigorous and replicable manner using reference geometry that articulates with the specific design attributes of each point. The goal of this effort was to increase both the precision and rigour of the study by including the Z-dimension to capture morphological characteristics associated with axial twisting introduced by knappers through beveling. While true that some landmarking protocols can be—–and often are—–recycled as new specimens are added, this particular research programme endeavours to achieve ever-greater accuracy and precision in each analytical iteration. This landmarking protocol was developed prior to running auto3dgm, and details the procedure for applying landmarks and equidistant semilandmarks; however, it may not reflect their actual placement on this specimen. 3.1 Generating the peripheral (plan view) spline This effort begins with a spline extracted from the surface geometry of the mesh using the extract contour curves command. In reverse-engineering, extract contour curves is regularly employed as the first step in building a patch network used to create a surface. The extracted feature curve is rendered as a spline, and follows the highest curvature contours around the periphery of the lateral and basal edges, following the highly variable sinuous edge morphology around the entirety of the projectile. The remainder of the landmarking protocol is based upon this spline, which was subsequently split at six mathematically-defined locations. knitr::include_graphics(&#39;images/extractspline.png&#39;) (#fig:lm3d2.figspline)Spline extracted along the highest contours of the Dalton point. 3.2 Splitting the spline Reference geometries are used in the assistance of creating other features. These include basic geometric entities, such as planes, vectors, coordinates, points, and polygons. A reference point is a virtual point and is used to mark a specific position on a model or in 3D space. A reference plane is a virtual plane that has a normal direction and an infinite size. A reference plane is not a surface body, and is used to create other features. The characteristic points and tangents developed for this landmarking protocol were inspired by the work of Birkhoff (1933), which has been gainfully employed within the context of both ceramic (Selden Jr. 2018a, 2018b, 2019, 2020) and lithic analyses (Selden Jr., Dockall, and Shafer 2018; Selden Jr., Dockall, and Dubied 2020). The first landmark (LM1) is placed at the horizontal tangent on the tip of each Dalton point. The second through fifth splits (LMs 02 - 05) occur at points of highest curvature, where LM2 is always placed on the right side of the projectile when oriented in 3D space following the alignment output of auto3dgm. To place the final landmark (LM6), a linear measurement was used to project a reference point equidistant between LM 02 and LM 03. The location of that point was leveraged in placing the reference plane used to cut the spline at the location of LM6. 3.3 Spline split at location of LM1 The horizontal tangent is calculated by drawing a horizontal line above the tip of the biface using the tangent as a common constraint, and the horizontal as the independent constraint. To split the 3D spline at the location of the horizontal tangent, a reference point was inserted at the location of the tangent in the sketch (light blue point; below, left), followed by a reference plane (in white; below, left and right) using the pick point and normal axis function where the reference point (h-tangent) was used as the pick point, and the Right plane as the normal axis (below, left). The spline was then cut at the location where the reference plane intersected with the spline (below image, right). knitr::include_graphics(&#39;images/lm1.png&#39;) (#fig:lm3d2.figlm1)Identify horizontal tangent, insert reference point and reference plane (left). Use reference plane to cut spline at the location of the horizontal tangent (right). 3.4 Spline split at locations of LM2 - LM3 The point of highest curvature on either side of the basal edge was calculated using the curvature function in the Accuracy Analyser. This function displays the curvature flow as a continuous colour plot across the area of the curve. In this instance, curvature is defined as the amount by which a geometric shape deviates from being flat or straight in the case of a line. The curvature is displayed in different colours according to the local radius, and is calculated in only one direction (U or V) along the curve. Using this tool, the two points of highest curvature were located between the basal and lateral edges on either side of each projectile where the local radius measure was largest. The alignment and orientation of each biface was dictated by the auto3dgm output, and the landmarking protocol follows the mesh orientation, where LM2 was always placed on the right side of the basal edge, and LM3 on the left. knitr::include_graphics(&#39;images/splinesplit1.png&#39;) (#fig:lm3d2.figcurve)Identify points of hightest curvature (light blue) at left/right intersection of lateral and basal edges. 3.5 Spline split at locations of LM4 - LM5 The point of highest curvature at the intersection of the blade and base was also calculated using the curvature function in the Accuracy Analyser. Using this tool, the two points of highest curvature were located between the blade and base on either side of each projectile where the local radius measure was largest. The alignment and orientation of each biface was dictated by the auto3dgm output, and the landmarking protocol follows the mesh orientation in that figure, where LM4 was always placed on the right side of the basal edge, and LM5 on the left. knitr::include_graphics(&#39;images/splinesplit2.png&#39;) (#fig:lm3d2.figcurve2)Identify points of hightest curvature (light blue) at left/right intersection of blade and base. 3.6 Spline split at location of LM6 One additional landmark (LM6) was placed at the centre of the base. The location of this landmark was identified by calculating the linear distance between LM2 and LM3, and projecting a reference point (ctrl-div; below) equidistant between the two. A reference plane was added using the ctrl-div as the pick point, and the Right plane as the normal axis. The spline was then split at the intersection of the reference plane and the basal spline. knitr::include_graphics(&#39;images/lm6.png&#39;) (#fig:lm3d2.figlm4)Calculate linear distance between LM2 and LM3, insert reference plane coplanar to Right plane equidistant between LM2 and LM3, and use the reference plane to cut the spline. 3.7 Peripheral (plan view) spline Through the preceding protocol, the initial spline was split into six discrete splines. These splines articulate with components of projectile morphology that can be compartmentalised in the analyses. The primary analytical gain achieved through this exercise is the requisite foundation needed to carry out replicable analyses of Dalton point morphology in three dimensions, further increasing the precision of the geometric morphometric analysis. knitr::include_graphics(&#39;images/splinesplit-frbl.png&#39;) (#fig:lm3d2.figsplinesplit-frbl)Result of spline splits include six discrete splines, each articulating with a region of analytical interest. 3.8 Reference vectors The fundamental components of reference geometry used to create LM3d2 are two reference vectors. The vectors were placed between LMs 01 and 06, and LMs 04 and 05, and serve as the basis for the remaining reference geometry needed to place the semilandmarks. knitr::include_graphics(&#39;images/lm3d2.vectors.png&#39;) (#fig:lm3d2.vectors)Reference vectors placed between LMs 01 and 06 (left), and between LMs 04 and 05 (right). 3.9 Reference planes and points Four reference planes provide the framework needed to populate the semilandmarks. Admittedly, the logic associated with placement may seem curious at this point; however, the utility of these reference planes will become clear in subsequent sections. 3.9.1 Placement of ref.pl.1 The first reference plane (ref.pl.1) was placed between LMs 01 and 06 in such a way that it bisects the projectile along the midline. The method of placement enlists a reference point (ref.pt.1), which was inserted along the first reference vector. It is located at a position equidistant between LMs 01 and 06, but the reference point coordinates were altered to relocate it 15 mm from the vector in the direction of the Z-axis. The pick point and coplanar function was used to place the plane coplanar to the first reference vector, and in the direction of ref.pt.1. Following placement of ref.pl.1, ref.pt.1 was deleted. knitr::include_graphics(&#39;images/lm3d2.ref.pl.1.png&#39;) (#fig:lm3d2.ref.pl.1)Placement of ref.pl.1, and location of ref.pt.1. 3.9.2 Placement of ref.pl.2 The second reference plane (ref.pl.2) was placed between LMs 04 and 05, and bisects the projectile at the blade/base intersection. The method of placement for ref.pl.2 follows the same protocol described in the previous section, and the reference point (ref.pt.2) was deleted following the placement of ref.pl.2. knitr::include_graphics(&#39;images/lm3d2.ref.pl.2.png&#39;) (#fig:lm3d2.ref.pl.2)Placement of ref.pl.2, and location of ref.pt.2. 3.9.3 Placement of ref.pl.3 and ref.pl.4 The third (ref.pl.3) and fourth (ref.pl.4) reference planes were placed using the pick point and normal function at the intersections of the first reference vector and LMs 01 and 06. knitr::include_graphics(&#39;images/lm3d2.ref.pl.3-4.png&#39;) (#fig:lm3d2.ref.pl.3-4)Placement of ref.pl.3 (top) and ref.pl.4 (bottom). 3.10 Sectioning the mesh The reference geometry described above was enlisted in the following three-step method developed to produce one cross-section at the blade/base intersection, four cross-sections between the blade/base intersection and LM 01, and one cross-section between the blade/base intersection and LM 06, to include one that articulates with the location of LM 06. 3.10.1 Sectioning the blade/base intersection To section the blade/base intersection, a single section was inserted using ref.pl.2, resulting in a single cross-section that bisects the projectile between LMs 04 and 05. knitr::include_graphics(&#39;images/lm3d2.section1.png&#39;) (#fig:lm3d2.section1)Placement of the first section, bisecting the mesh along ref.pl.2. 3.10.2 Sectioning the blade and base A single reference point (ref.pt.3) was placed equidistant along the reference vector between LMs 04 and 05. Six equidistant sections were placed between LM 01 and ref.pt.3, and the two sections at the locations of LM 01 and ref.pt.3 were deleted. Three equidistant sections were placed between LM 06 and ref.pt.3. The section intersecting with ref.pt.3 was deleted. Subsequent to placing the sections, ref.pt.3 was itself deleted. knitr::include_graphics(&#39;images/lm3d2.all.sections.png&#39;) (#fig:lm3d2.section3)Placement of the two equidistant sections between LM 06 and ref.pt.3. 3.11 Splitting the sections The curvature function was employed to split the spline at the location of highest curvature. This function was detailed in the application of LMs 02, 03, 04, and 05 in LM3d1. Each section was split at the point of highest curvature along the lateral margins. The reference plane ref.pl.1 was then used to cut each curve along the mid-line where it intersects with the curves. knitr::include_graphics(&#39;images/lm3d2.split.sections.png&#39;) (#fig:lm3d2.split)Each section was split at the points of highest curvature along the lateral edges, then along the mid-line at the intersection of the curve and ref.pl.1. 3.12 Applying the semilandmarks Semilandmarks 07 - 20 were first applied around the lateral edges, and sLMs 13 and 14 between LMs 02, 06, and 03 uses the curve constructed in LM3d1. Semilandmarks 21 - 32 articulate with the mid-line between LMs 01 and 06. Additional sLMs (33 - 57) were placed on each section equidistant between those sLMs defined by the splits described above. The result is a landmark configuration that can be subset in numerous ways (plan, profile, cross-section, front/back, left/right, blade/base, etc.), and was designed to achieve maximum utility for analysts of lithic morphology. knitr::include_graphics(&#39;images/lm3d2.semi.png&#39;) (#fig:lm3d2.semi)Landmarks (blue), semilandmarks (white), curves (orange), and splits (blue) used for LM3d2.

I express my gratitude to colleagues past and present for providing the comments, constructive criticisms, and motivation needed to continue this pursuit of a rigorous and replicable design-based landmarking protocol.

["open.html", "Chapter 5 Open Review 5.1 FAQ about open review 5.2 Privacy and Consent Policy", " Chapter 5 Open Review Open Review means that you can freely read this volume and easily help to make it better. You can offer suggestions by making annotations using hypothes.is, an open source annotation system. This is a simple system for interacting with this volume. If you are familiar with GitHub or Git, you can also comment using GitHub’s issue tracker for the volume, or make a pull request. In addition to these feedback options, this website for the book will be collecting your implicit feedback by tracking the readership and abandonment rate of each section. Open Review takes place before and during the peer review process. The feedback from Open Review and peer review will be used to create a revised manuscript. The Open Review period will end when the final manuscript is submitted to the publisher. The concept of Open Review, as implemented here, is taken from Matthew Salganik’s Open Review Toolkit. Much of the text on this page comes from the Open Review Toolkit About page and the Open Review Toolkit Privacy and Consent page 5.1 FAQ about open review 5.1.1 What kind of feedback are you looking for? Open Review is not just about catching typos. Rather, Open Review is designed to collect all types of feedback, and I would particularly welcome feedback that relates to the substance of the volume. Are there sections that you find particularly confusing? Are their points that you find particularly important? Am I making claims that you think need to be refined? Are there parts of the book that you think should be removed? When in doubt, I ask that you follow one of the main principles at Wikipedia: Be bold. 5.1.2 Can I see the annotations that others are making? Yes, all annotations are public. You can view them on right side of the each page. 5.1.3 What are the benefits for readers? You get to read the manuscript and participate in making it better. 5.1.4 What are the benefits for authors and publishers? The Open Review process will benefit both authors and publishers, even if they have no interest in increasing access to knowledge. The process will lead to higher manuscript quality through the explicit and implicit feedback. Further, the Open Review process will provide valuable data that can be used during that marketing of the book. 5.1.5 Has anyone ever done something like this before? This is based on Matthew Salganik’s Open Review Toolkit. He has written about some related efforts here: http://www.bitbybitbook.com/en/open-review/ 5.1.6 What kind of information are you collecting and how will that information be used? Please read the privacy and consent policy, below. 5.1.7 How I can learn more about traditional peer review of academic books? The AAUP recently published a report on best practices for peer review. 5.1.8 Can I do this with my book? Absolutely. View the code for this website at https://github.com/aksel-blaise/dalton for more about how we did it. 5.1.9 I have a different question about Open Review. How can I get in touch? Send an email to zselden@sfasu.edu 5.2 Privacy and Consent Policy 5.2.1 Overview The complete text of the supplementary data is made available on this website at no cost. While you are reading the volume, reader behavior is measured in aggregate. For example, which sections of the book get read most often is measured. These data will help to improve the book. 5.2.2 What information do we collect? Google Analytics is used to collect information about how you interact with this website. Further, like most websites, cookies are used to enhance your experience, gather general visitor information, and track visits to the website. Please refer to the “do we use cookies?” section below for information about cookies and how we use them. 5.2.3 How do we use your information? Any of the information that we collect may be used for research, to improve the supplementary data. 5.2.4 How do we protect your information? A variety of security measures is used to maintain the safety of the information that you provide. Most of the browsing information that we gather is stored in Google Analytics, and you can read more about their security and privacy principles. Annotations that you can add are managed by hypothes.is, and you can read more about their terms of service. Our website is hosted by Github Pages, and you can read more about Github’s terms of service. 5.2.5 Do we use cookies? Yes. Cookies are small files that a site or its service provider transfers to your computer’s hard drive through your web browser (if you allow) that enables the sites or service providers systems to recognize your browser and capture and remember certain information. In order to offer you a better site experience, cookies are used to understand and save your preferences for future visits, and to compile aggregate data regarding site traffic. 5.2.6 Your consent By using this site, you consent to the privacy policy. 5.2.7 Questions If you have any questions, please contact me by email at zselden@sfasu.edu 5.2.8 Changes to our Privacy and Consent Policy I reserve the right to this privacy policy from time to time at my discretion. Please periodically check this section to review the current version of the Privacy and Consent Policy. All previous policies are included in the associated repository, and this page will be updated if any changes are needed. 5.2.9 Acknowledgments The bulk of the (modified) text above comes from Ben Marwick’s bookdown example that illustrates how each of the pieces of this volume function independently, and as a whole. Many thanks to Ben for making this available, and I encourage other archaeologists to make use of these tools. "],
