Selden, Jr.1 2020-11-09 Preface Reproducibilitythe ability to recompute resultsand replicabilitythe chances other experimenters will achieve a consistent resultare two foundational characteristics of successful scientific research (Leek and Peng 2015). This volume is written in Markdown, and all files needed to reproduce it are included in the GitHub repository. The reproducible nature of this undertaking provides a means for others to critically assess and evaluate the various analytical components (Gray and Marwick 2019; Peng 2011; Gandrud 2014), which is a necessary requirement for the production of reliable knowledge. Reproducibility projects in psychology and cancer biology are impacting current research practices across all domains. Examples of reproducible research are becoming more abundant in archaeology (Marwick 2016; Ivanovait et al. 2020; Selden Jr., Dockall, and Dubied 2020), and the next generation of archaeologists are learning those tools and methods needed to reproduce and/or replicate research results (Marwick et al. 2019). Reproducible and replicable research work flows are often employed at the highest levels of humanities-based inquiries to mitigate concern or doubt regarding proper execution, and is of particular import should the results haveexplicitly or implicitlya major impact on scientific progress (Peels and Bouter 2018). Components of the undertaking presented in this volume are novel, and this basic research endeavour is rooted in archaeological epistemology. Sharing data is not enough, and if investigators share only data absent their analysis code, that places a substantive burden on those who may seek to build upon or replicate their work in the future. In this instance, the choice to pursue a replicable work flow occurs based on the simple fact that this work is foundational, and meant to begin a meaningful discussion related to projectile morphology. As an exploratory research endeavour, this study was not preregistered. 0.1 Acknowledgments I extend my gratitude to Christian S. Hoggard and David K. Thulman for their thoughtful comments and constructive criticisms on the draft of the landmarking protocol developed for the study of Gahagan bifaces (Selden Jr., Dockall, and Dubied 2020), which is extended here for an analysis of Dalton point morphology. Additional thanks to Christian S. Hoggard for fielding questions related to the EFA analysis. This iteration of the landmarking protocol was initially developed using the digit3DLand package in R, and I am grateful to Morgane Dubied for her help with coding questions. 0.2 Funding Components of this analytical work flow were developed and funded by a Preservation Technology and Training grant (P14AP00138) to the author from the National Center for Preservation Technology and Training (NCPTT), as well as grants from the National Forests and Grasslands in Texas (15-PA-11081300-033) and the United States Forest Service (20-PA-11081300-074).

For the in/out of Heartland hypothesis, there is a significant difference in plan view shape that is driven by the lateral edges along the left/right sides of the biface. This suggests that two of the equidistant semilandmarks employed in the landmarking configuration (sLMs 12 and 13) may not be necessary if the driver of the morphological difference that occurs in/out of the Heartland rests along the lateral edge (see section 1.7 in the previous chapter). For the Heartland regions (hreg) hypothesis, the lateral edges along the left/right sides of the biface appear to drive the morphological differences once more. In one case (Heartland vs. Northern Periphery), the difference is significant, and driven by one side of the base, but primarily by the left/right lateral edges. The only other significant difference is between the Heartland vs. Interior, with the heartland being represented by lateral edges that are generally narrower than those of the interior. The Interior vs. Northern Periphery does not differ significantly; however, the mean shapes indicate that it is basalnot blademorphology that may differentiate those populations. This outcome also suggests that sLMs 12 and 13 may not be warranted The comparison of beveled vs. not beveled bifaces yielded a significant difference, which is driven (once more) by the left/right lateral edges, and not the distal end of the base. This suggests, once more, that sLMs 12 and 13 are not needed for the analysis. The only significant difference between the bevel types was the comparison of alternate vs. no beveling. Mean shapes indicate that this difference is driven by the left/right lateral edges, and not by the morphology of the distal portion of the base. The mean shapes for unifacial bimarginal vs. no beveling are surprisingly similar in plan view, and the difference between alternate vs. unifacial bimarginal is drivenonce moreby left/right lateral edges from the base to the tip of the point, and not the distal end of the base. Of those landmark and semilandmark configurations included in the draft sketches for this project, it is sLMs 12 and 13 that appear to contribute least to the formal tests of those hypotheses tested using EFA; however, those sLMs may have utility in an analysis of object symmetry and fluctuating asymmetry. 1.1 Overview Landmarking protocol 3d3 (LM3d3) represents a substantive advancement from LM3d1 (Selden Jr., Dockall, and Dubied 2020) and was modified from the LM3d2 protocol developed for the analysis of Gahagan bifaces. The principal difference between LM3d2 and LM3d3 is that the projectiles analysed using LM3d2 are lanceolate bifaces, and that landmarking protocol was not designed to capture the variation in basal morphology exhibited by stemmed (Dalton) projectile points. Like LM3d1 and LM3d2, LM3d3 uses the topology of the 3D mesh that articulates with the prehistoric design of each projectile point to construct a suite of reference geometry used to apply semilandmarks in a replicable manner. The result is a landmarking protocol that provides for the improved characterisation of whole-object morphology, which can be subset to analyse variability associated with specific plan, profile, and cross-section components. It also provides those data points needed to investigate questions of directional asymmetry, differences in front/back morphology, morphological integration between blade and basal morphology, and the morphology of broken, fractured, or otherwise incomplete specimens that permeate the archaeological record. knitr::include_graphics(&#39;images/landmarks.png&#39;) (#fig:lm3d3.landmark)Figure 1. Coordinates of landmarks populated using the LM3d1 protocol serve as the basis for LM3d3. Like its predecessors, LM3d3 was initially designed using the digit3DLand package in R. When the draft protocol was completed, design of the landmarking protocol shifted to Geomagic Design X (Build Version 2020.0.2 [Build Number: 55]), where the workflow was modified to include those elements of reference geometry that articulate with the prehistoric design attributes of each projectile point. The goal of this effort was to increase both the precision and rigour of the study by including the Z-dimension to capture those shape characteristics associated with axial twisting, introduced by knappers through the practice of beveling (LM3d1) (Selden Jr., Dockall, and Dubied 2020). The addition of cross-sections was needed to better characterise whole-object morphology, providing for the possibility of subsampling the semilandmarks to explore the contribution of specific cross-sections or profiles (LM3d2). LM3d3 includes an additional cross section at the blade/base transition, allowing for tests of morphological integration. While true that some landmarking protocols can beand often arerecycled as new specimens are added, this particular research programme endeavours to achieve ever-greater accuracy and precision in each analytical iteration. 1.2 Generating the peripheral (plan view) spline This effort begins with a spline extracted from the surface geometry of the mesh using the extract contour curves command. In reverse-engineering, extract contour curves is regularly employed as the first step in building a patch network used to create a surface. The extracted feature curve is rendered as a spline, and follows the highest curvature contours around the periphery of the lateral and basal edges, following the highly variable sinuous edge morphology around the entirety of the projectile. The remainder of the landmarking protocol is based upon this spline, which was subsequently split at six mathematically-defined locations. knitr::include_graphics(&#39;images/extractspline.png&#39;) (#fig:lm3d3.figspline)Figure 2. Spline extracted along the highest contours of the Dalton point. 1.3 Splitting the spline Reference geometries are used in the assistance of creating other features. These include basic geometric entities, such as planes, vectors, coordinates, points, and polygons. A reference point is a virtual point and is used to mark a specific position on a model or in 3D space. A reference plane is a virtual plane that has a normal direction and an infinite size. A reference plane is not a surface body, and is used to create other features. The characteristic points and tangents developed for this landmarking protocol were inspired by the work of Birkhoff (1933), which has been gainfully employed within the context of both ceramic (Selden Jr. 2018a, 2018b, 2019, 2021) and lithic analyses (Selden Jr., Dockall, and Shafer 2018; Selden Jr., Dockall, and Dubied 2020). The first landmark (LM1) is placed at the horizontal tangent on the tip of each Dalton point. The second through fifth splits (LMs 02 - 05) occur at points of highest curvature, where LM 02 is always placed on the right side of the projectile following the application of the reference vectors. To place the final landmark (LM 06), a linear measurement was used to project a reference point equidistant between LM 02 and LM 03. The location of that point was leveraged in placing the reference plane used to cut the spline at the location of LM 06. 1.4 Spline split at location of LM 01 The horizontal tangent is calculated by drawing a horizontal line above the tip of the biface using the tangent as a common constraint, and the horizontal as the independent constraint. To split the 3D spline at the location of the horizontal tangent, a reference point was inserted at the location of the tangent in the sketch (light blue point; below, left), followed by a reference plane (in white; below, left and right) using the pick point and normal axis function where the reference point (h-tangent) was used as the pick point, and the Right plane as the normal axis (below, left). The spline was then cut at the location where the reference plane intersected with the spline (below image, right). knitr::include_graphics(&#39;images/lm1.png&#39;) (#fig:lm3d3.figlm1)Figure 3. Identify horizontal tangent, insert reference point and reference plane (left). Use reference plane to cut spline at the location of the horizontal tangent (right). 1.5 Spline split at locations of LM 02 and LM 03 The point of highest curvature on either side of the basal edge was calculated using the curvature function in the Accuracy Analyser. This function displays the curvature flow as a continuous colour plot across the area of the curve. In this instance, curvature is defined as the amount by which a geometric shape deviates from being flat or straight in the case of a line. Curvature is displayed in different colours according to the local radius, and calculated in only one direction (U or V) along the curve. Using this tool, the two points of highest curvature were located between the basal and lateral edges on either side of each projectile where the local radius measure was largest. The orientation of each biface was dictated by the auto3dgm output in LM3d1 and LM3d2; however, LM3d3 enlists a novel method to determine which side of the projectile is associated with LM 02 and LM03 using reference vectors. knitr::include_graphics(&#39;images/splinesplit1.png&#39;) (#fig:lm3d3.figcurve)Figure 4. Identify points of hightest curvature (light blue) at left/right intersection of lateral and basal edges. 1.6 Spline split at locations of LM 04 and LM 05 The point of highest curvature at the intersection of the blade and base was also calculated using the curvature function in the Accuracy Analyser. Using this tool, the two points of highest curvature were located between the blade and base on either side of each projectile where the local radius measure was largest. The orientation of each projectile was dictated by reference vectors, and the landmarking protocol follows the mesh orientation in that figure, where LM 04 was always placed on the right side of the basal edge, and LM 05 on the left. knitr::include_graphics(&#39;images/splinesplit2.png&#39;) (#fig:lm3d3.figcurve2)Figure 5. Identify points of hightest curvature (light blue) at left/right intersection of blade and base. 1.7 Spline split at location of LM 06 One additional landmark (LM 06) was placed at the centre of the base. The location of this landmark was identified by calculating the linear distance between LM 02 and LM 03, and projecting a reference point (ctrl-div; below) equidistant between the two. A reference plane was added using the ctrl-div as the pick point, and the Right plane as the normal axis. The spline was then split at the intersection of the reference plane and the basal spline. knitr::include_graphics(&#39;images/lm6.png&#39;) (#fig:lm3d3.figlm4)Figure 6. Calculate linear distance between LM 02 and LM 03, insert reference plane coplanar to Right plane equidistant between LM 02 and LM 03, and use the reference plane to cut the spline. 1.8 Peripheral (plan view) spline Through the preceding protocol, the initial spline was split into six discrete splines. These splines articulate with components of projectile morphology that can be compartmentalised in the analyses. The primary analytical gain achieved through this exercise is the requisite foundation needed to carry out replicable analyses of Dalton point morphology in three dimensions, further increasing the precision of the geometric morphometric analysis. knitr::include_graphics(&#39;images/splinesplit-frbl.png&#39;) (#fig:lm3d3.figsplinesplit-frbl)Figure 7. Result of spline splits include six discrete splines, each articulating with a region of analytical interest. The coordinates of each spline split are known, and used to place the landmarks. 1.9 Reference vectors and ref.pt.0 The fundamental components of reference geometry used to create LM3d3 consist of three reference vectors, and a single reference point (ref.pt.0), placed equidistant between LM 04 and LM 05. The three reference vectors were placed between LM 01 and ref.pt.0 (Vector 1), ref.pt.0 and LM 06 (Vector 2), and LMs 04 and 05 (Vector 3). These three reference vectors serve as the foundation for the suite of reference geometry used to place the semilandmarks. knitr::include_graphics(&#39;images/lm3d3.vectors.png&#39;) (#fig:lm3d3.vectors)Figure 8. Reference vectors placed between LMs 01 and ref.pt.0 (left), ref.pt.0 and LM 06 (center), and between LMs 04 and 05 (right). The measure of the angle between Vector 1 (blade) and Vector 2 (base) may have additional utility in lithic studies as an orthogonal metric associated with knapper skill, where greater skill is represented by an arbitrary range of angles nearestand lesser, furthest away from180 degrees. A second similar measure could be collected between Vectors 1 and 2 in comparison with Vector 3. Collection of these metrics from a 3D mesh in computer aided design (CAD) software adds an increased element of precision in comparison with a goniometer, and serves as an example of the added analytical value that can be extracted from this novel landmarking protocol. Prior to the addition of the reference vectors, the location of LMs 02 through 05 are considered arbitrary. Previous iterations of this landmarking protocol have relied upon auto3dgm to provide principal alignments that dictate which LMs are placed on the left/right side of the biface or projectile. In this protocol, the side of the projectile with the lowest orthogonal measure between Vector 1 and Vector 2 will be on the left, meaning that from the investigators view, the projectiles will curve, bend, or lean slightlyor in some cases more dramaticallyto the left from base to tip. 1.10 Reference planes and points Five reference planes provide the framework needed to populate the semilandmarks. Admittedly, the logic associated with placement may seem curious at this point; however, the utility of these reference planes will become clear in subsequent sections. 1.10.1 Placement of ref.pl.1 The first reference plane (ref.pl.1) was placed between LM 01 and ref.pt.0, bisecting the blade of the projectile along the mid-line. The method of placement enlists a reference point (ref.pt.1), inserted at the intersection of the three reference vectors. It has the same x,y position as ref.pt.0, but the coordinates of ref.pt.1 were altered to relocate it 15 mm from the vector in the direction of the Z-axis. The pick point and coplanar function was used to place ref.pl.1 coplanar to the first reference vector, and in the direction of ref.pt.1. knitr::include_graphics(&#39;images/lm3d3.ref.pl.1.png&#39;) (#fig:lm3d3.ref.pl.1)Figure 9. Placement of ref.pl.1, and temporary location of ref.pt.1 15mm from Vector 1, and equidistant between LM 01 and ref.pt.0 on the blade of the projectile. 1.10.2 Placement of ref.pl.2 The second reference plane (ref.pl.2) was placed between ref.pt.0 and LM 06, bisecting the base of the projectile along the mid-line. The method of placement for ref.pl.2 follows the same protocol described in the application of ref.pl.1, and enlists the same reference point (ref.pt.1). knitr::include_graphics(&#39;images/lm3d3.ref.pl.2.png&#39;) (#fig:lm3d3.ref.pl.2)Figure 10. Placement of ref.pl.2, and temporary location of ref.pt.2 15 mm from Vector 2, and equidistant between ref.pt.0 and LM 06 on the base of the projectile. 1.10.3 Placement of ref.pl.3 The third reference plane (ref.pl.3) was placed between LMs 04 and 05, and bisects the projectile at the blade/base intersection. The method of placement for ref.pl.3 follows the same protocol described in the application of ref.pl.1, and enlists the same reference point (ref.pt.1), which was deleted following the placement of ref.pl.3. knitr::include_graphics(&#39;images/lm3d3.ref.pl.3.png&#39;) (#fig:lm3d3.ref.pl.3)Figure 11. Placement of ref.pl.3, and temporary location of ref.pt.3 15 mm from Vector 3, and equidistant between LMs 04 and 05 at the intersection of the blade and base. 1.10.4 Placement of ref.pl.4 and ref.pl.5 The fourth (ref.pl.4) and fifth (ref.pl.5) reference planes were placed using the pick point and normal function at the intersections of the first reference vector and LMs 01 and 06. knitr::include_graphics(&#39;images/lm3d3.ref.pl.4-5.png&#39;) (#fig:lm3d3.ref.pl.4-5)Figure 12. Placement of ref.pl.4 (top) and ref.pl.5 (bottom). 1.11 Sectioning the mesh The reference geometry described above was enlisted in the following three-step method developed to produce one cross-section at the blade/base intersection, four cross-sections between the blade/base intersection and LM 01, and one cross-section between the blade/base intersection and LM 06. 1.11.1 Sectioning the blade/base intersection To section the blade/base intersection, a single section was inserted using ref.pl.2, resulting in a single cross-section that bisects the projectile between LMs 04 and 05. knitr::include_graphics(&#39;images/lm3d3.section1.png&#39;) (#fig:lm3d3.section1)Figure 13. Placement of the first section, bisecting the mesh along ref.pl.2. 1.11.2 Sectioning the blade and base Six equidistant sections were placed between LM 01 and ref.pt.0, and the two sections at the locations of LM 01 and ref.pt.0 were deleted. Three equidistant sections were placed between LM 06 and ref.pt.0. The sections intersecting with ref.pt.0 and LM 06 were deleted. Subsequent to placing the sections, ref.pt.0 was itself deleted. knitr::include_graphics(&#39;images/lm3d3.all.sections.png&#39;) (#fig:lm3d3.section3)Figure 14. Placement of the two equidistant sections between LM 06 and ref.pt.3. 1.12 Splitting the sections The curvature function was employed to split each curves at the locations of highest curvature along the lateral edge. This function was detailed above, and in the application of LMs 02, 03, 04, and 05 in LM3d1. A reference plane (ref.pl.1) was then used to cut each of the four curves along the mid-line of the blade where it intersects with the curves. A second reference plane (ref.pl.2) was used to cut the single basal curve and the curve between LMs 04 and 05. Since ref.pt.0 was used to generate ref.pl.1 and ref.pl.2, either of the reference planes could be used to cut the curve between LMs 04 and 05. knitr::include_graphics(&#39;images/lm3d3.split.sections.png&#39;) (#fig:lm3d3.split)Figure 15. Each section was split at the points of highest curvature along the lateral edges, then along the mid-line at the intersection of the curve and ref.pl.1 (for the blade), and ref.pl.2 (for the base). 1.13 LM3d3: Configuration 1 LM3d3: Configuration 1 (LM3d3.c1) was used to assess the three hypotheses included in this pilot study. Semilandmarks 07 - 18 were applied around the lateral edges, and sLMs 12 and 13 between LMs 02, 06, and 03 using the curve constructed in LM3d1. Semilandmarks 19 - 30 articulate with the mid-line between LMs 01 and 06, and sLMs 31 - 34 were placed along the curve that articulates with ref.pl.3 equidistant between the lateral edge and midline. . The result is a landmark configuration that can be subset in numerous ways (plan, profile, cross-section, front/back, left/right, blade/base, etc.), using a suite of design-based attributes to achieve maximum utility for analysts of lithic morphology. knitr::include_graphics(&#39;images/lm3d3.semi.png&#39;) (#fig:lm3d3.semi)Figure 16. Landmarks (blue), semilandmarks (white), curves (orange), and splits (blue) used for LM3d3. Based upon knowledge garnered from running LaSEC (Watanabe 2018) on LM3d1, this landmarking protocol would likely be oversampled if it included additional landmarks on the cross-sections; however, it can be adapted to include as many or as few landmarks and semilandmarks needed to address the research question. knitr::include_graphics(&#39;images/lm3d3.slm.png&#39;) (#fig:lm3d3.slm)Figure 17.

Here, the shape coordinates are projected onto tangent space because pairwise distances among corresponding datasets later in the analysis are based on Euclidean distances and most shape analyses in the biological literature are conducted in tangent space instead of Procrustes shape space. Subsample the same three randomly selected landmarks from all specimens. The subsampling begins with a subset of three landmarks because a minimum of three landmarks is required to define shape. Then, generate shape and centroid size data with generalized Procrustes superimposition on the subsampled data. Perform an Ordinary Procrustes Alignment (protest function in the vegan R package) on the subsampled data to minimize the pairwise distances between corresponding landmarks in the parent data through translation, rotation, and scaling of data in full shape space. As stated above, note that this procedure is different from the typical implementation of Procrustes alignment on coordinate data in 2-D or 3-D space. The function then records the sum of these squared distances as measure of fit (PSS) between the relative locations of data points in the parent and subsampled datasets. Equivalent procedure is conducted on centroid size data. Sample one additional, randomly chosen landmark and repeat step 3 until the entire set of landmarks in the parent dataset is sampled. The completion of this step represents one iteration of subsampling. Repeat steps 25 for specified number of iterations (iter argument). Create sampling curves by plotting the trajectory of fit (1PSS) against the number of landmarks sampled from each iteration for both shape and centroid size as gray lines. Then, plot the median fit value for each number of landmarks sampled on the same plot as a thick, dark line. Finally, output these sampling curves: LaSEC_SamplingCurve_Shape.pdf, LaSEC_SamplingCurve_Size.pdf. 2.1 Analysis of experimental sample # load package

0.99. For centroid size, seven landmarks were needed to achieve a median fit value of 0.99. knitr::include_graphics(&#39;images/lasec.png&#39;) (#fig:fig.lasec.EX)Sampling curves from performing LaSEC on the dataset with respect to characterising shape variation. Each gray line indicates fit values from one iteration of subsampling. Thick, dark line denotes median fit value at each number of landmarks. LaSEC sampling curve for shape (left), and for centroid size (right). Results produced using the code above for this 3D dataset, using 1,000 iterations. Images converted to PNG following export. Results demonstrate saltation, illustrating that some landmarks are critical for capturing shape information (Watanabe 2018). Dynamic as Dalton points may be in shape, that variation may be captured with a configuration of landmarks that employed fewer semilandmarks.

Procrustes superimposition translates, scales, and rotates the coordinate data to allow for comparisons among objects (Gower 1975; Rohlf and Slice 1990). The geomorph package uses a partial Procrustes superimposition that projects the aligned specimens into tangent space subsequent to alignment in preparation for the use of multivariate methods that assume linear space (Rohlf 1999; Slice 2001). # gpa Y.gpa &lt;- gpagen(coords, PrinAxes = TRUE, ProcD = TRUE, Proj = TRUE, print.progress = FALSE) # output + consensus configuration coords Y.gpa ## ## Call: ## gpagen(A = coords, PrinAxes = TRUE, ProcD = TRUE, Proj = TRUE, print.progress = FALSE) ## ## ## ## Generalized Procrustes Analysis ## with Partial Procrustes Superimposition ## ## 34 fixed landmarks ## 0 semilandmarks (sliders) ## 3-dimensional landmarks ## 3 GPA iterations to converge ## ## ## Consensus (mean) Configuration ## ## X Y Z ## 1 -3.268671e-01 -0.0011931089 -0.0009377369 ## 2 2.192642e-01 0.1164491016 -0.0012498234 ## 3 2.147223e-01 -0.1217478874 0.0009655446 ## 4 8.316453e-02 0.1191513799 -0.0014357817 ## 5 8.155550e-02 -0.1167459370 0.0003560951 ## 6 1.963654e-01 -0.0022976342 0.0003251209 ## 7 -2.453379e-01 0.0464761668 0.0017321575 ## 8 -1.635771e-01 0.0694248052 0.0009017659 ## 9 -8.175002e-02 0.0841568734 0.0008467646 ## 10 9.241075e-05 0.0988028012 -0.0002139871 ## 11 1.432768e-01 0.1128257384 -0.0015009175 ## 12 2.158856e-01 0.0590038463 -0.0011516607 ## 13 2.173095e-01 -0.0639650736 0.0004374384 ## 14 1.359703e-01 -0.1129258289 -0.0002054459 ## 15 1.266957e-03 -0.0950553042 -0.0011137807 ## 16 -8.071735e-02 -0.0817674260 -0.0022469586 ## 17 -1.627377e-01 -0.0686451873 -0.0016601164 ## 18 -2.437943e-01 -0.0478428141 -0.0018220353 ## 19 -2.450317e-01 -0.0007390773 0.0212394785 ## 20 -1.631453e-01 -0.0002063707 0.0281155068 ## 21 -8.124892e-02 0.0002749048 0.0310029909 ## 22 6.837415e-04 0.0007960798 0.0312604795 ## 23 8.229699e-02 0.0013141225 0.0281397203 ## 24 1.392282e-01 -0.0004667701 0.0213685477 ## 25 1.396402e-01 -0.0005995783 -0.0206159046 ## 26 8.241437e-02 0.0011440644 -0.0268637367 ## 27 8.125979e-04 0.0006702931 -0.0299061655 ## 28 -8.110832e-02 0.0002166583 -0.0293422934 ## 29 -1.630518e-01 -0.0002911919 -0.0272081177 ## 30 -2.449731e-01 -0.0007590126 -0.0208189861 ## 31 8.277176e-02 0.0634369277 0.0233498873 ## 32 8.186894e-02 -0.0608167801 0.0241180008 ## 33 8.192933e-02 -0.0609531280 -0.0232982094 ## 34 8.282089e-02 0.0628743472 -0.0225678411 # geomorph data frame gdf &lt;- geomorph.data.frame(shape = Y.gpa$coords, size = Y.gpa$Csize, heart = qdata$heart.out, hreg = qdata$heart.reg, bev.1 = qdata$bev, bev.2 = qdata$bev.type) # plot consensus configuration par(mfrow=c(1, 3)) plot(Y.gpa$consensus[,c(&quot;Y&quot;, &quot;X&quot;)], pch=20) plot(Y.gpa$consensus[,c(&quot;Z&quot;, &quot;X&quot;)], pch=20) plot(Y.gpa$consensus[,c(&quot;Z&quot;, &quot;Y&quot;)], pch=20) Figure 3.1: 2D plot of 3D consensus configuration. # render 3d gpa plot #plot(Y.gpa) # gpa plot # knitr::include_graphics(&#39;images/gpa3d.png&#39;) 3.2.1 Boxplot attributes # add centroid size to qdata qdata$csz &lt;- Y.gpa$Csize # print updated qdata with centroid size knitr::kable(qdata, align = &quot;ccccc&quot;, caption = &quot;Modified attributes included in qdata.&quot;) (#tab:box.attr)Modified attributes included in qdata. heart.out heart.reg bev bev.type csz 11AI225 H H y unifacial.bimarginal 111.17971 11HE445 N P n no.bevel 125.68376 HK49_1462 N I n no.bevel 106.02942 HK49_2 N I n no.bevel 77.88910 HK49_3022 N I n no.bevel 100.02205 HK49_3823 N I n no.bevel 112.93309 HK49_4 N I n no.bevel 118.11018 HK49_5928 N I y alternate 121.33863 HK49_5961 N I n no.bevel 102.86813 HK49_7 N I y unifacial.bimarginal 104.40945 KeilMangold10 H H y alternate 126.59440 KeilMangold13 H H y alternate 143.47265 KeilMangold14 H H y alternate 147.46915 KeilMangold17 H H y alternate 105.16645 KeilMangold24 H H y alternate 111.45604 KeilMangold3 H H y alternate 126.88410 KeilMangold42 H H y alternate 116.67686 KeilMangold64 H H y alternate 139.46602 KeilMangold8 H H y alternate 104.38197 KeilMangold90 H H y alternate 110.38118 Kinzer46 N P n no.bevel 92.72096 Kinzer49 N P n no.bevel 86.46909 Kinzer50 N P y alternate 86.54094 Leprechaun11MS1983FSI800-5 H H y alternate 193.20788 MA1699p1 H H y alternate 162.77316 MA1699p3 H H n no.bevel 134.02270 McL4_158 N I y alternate 72.68131 McL4_614 N I n no.bevel 95.77598 McL7_101 N I n no.bevel 82.38421 McL7_168 N I n no.bevel 101.23743 Nochta11MS128BFSI267-1 H H y alternate 104.48051 Nochta11MS128bFSIPP1001 H H y alternate 164.44493 Nochta11MS128BFSIPP2495 H H y alternate 91.73625 Nochta11MS128BFSIPP3305 H H y alternate 67.26310 Nochta11MS12BFIS800-168 H H y alternate 111.63691 OH1_176 N I n no.bevel 83.95530 ReedVoss2 H H y alternate 120.36607 TR10_4 N I n no.bevel 73.36491 Welton1 N P n no.bevel 222.31528 Welton2 N P y alternate 134.84432 Welton4 N P y alternate 166.09451 Welton5 N P y unifacial.bimarginal 188.68723 # attributes for boxplots csz &lt;- qdata$csz # centroid size heart &lt;- qdata$heart.out # heartland in/out hreg &lt;- qdata$heart.reg # heartland region bev.1 &lt;- qdata$bev # beveled yes/no bev.2 &lt;- qdata$bev.type # type of beveling 3.3 Principal Components Analysis Principal components analysis (Jolliffe 2002) was used to visualise shape variation among the bifaces.

A residual randomization permutation procedure (RRPP; n = 10,000 permutations) was used for all Procrustes ANOVAs (Adams and Collyer 2015; Collyer and Adams 2018), which has higher statistical power and a greater ability to identify patterns in the data should they be present (Anderson and Ter Braak 2003). To assess whether shape changes with size (allometry), and differs by group (region), Procrustes ANOVAs (Goodall 1991) were also run that enlist effect-sizes (zscores) computed as standard deviates of the generated sampling distributions (Collyer, Sekora, and Adams 2015). knitr::include_graphics(&#39;images/dalton-vizhypothesis1.jpg&#39;) (#fig:lm3d3.a1.h1)Hypothesis 1 considers whether Dalton points discovered in (left) and out (right) of the Heartland differ in morphology. 3.6.1 Boxplot (H1) # boxplot of Dalton point centroid size by in/out heartland csz.hrt &lt;- ggplot(qdata, aes(x = heart, y = csz, color = heart)) + geom_boxplot() + geom_dotplot(binaxis = &#39;y&#39;, stackdir = &#39;center&#39;, dotsize = 0.3) + scale_colour_manual(values = wes_palette(&quot;Moonrise2&quot;)) + theme(legend.position = &quot;none&quot;) + labs(x = &#39;In Heartland?&#39;, y = &#39;Centroid Size&#39;) # render plot csz.hrt ## `stat_bindot()` using `bins = 30`.

A residual randomization permutation procedure (RRPP; n = 10,000 permutations) was used for all Procrustes ANOVAs (Adams and Collyer 2015; Collyer and Adams 2018), which has higher statistical power and a greater ability to identify patterns in the data should they be present (Anderson and Ter Braak 2003). To assess whether shape changes with size (allometry), and differs by group (region), Procrustes ANOVAs (Goodall 1991) were also run that enlist effect-sizes (zscores) computed as standard deviates of the generated sampling distributions (Collyer, Sekora, and Adams 2015). knitr::include_graphics(&#39;images/dalton-vizhypothesis4-1.jpg&#39;) (#fig:lm3d3.a1.h4)Hypothesis 4 considers whether discrete beveling practices articulate with differences in the morphology of Dalton points 3.9.1 Boxplot (H4) # boxplot of Dalton point centroid size by bevel type csz.bev.2 &lt;- ggplot(qdata, aes(x = bev.2, y = csz, color = bev.2)) + geom_boxplot() + geom_dotplot(binaxis = &#39;y&#39;, stackdir = &#39;center&#39;, dotsize = 0.3) + scale_colour_manual(values = wes_palette(&quot;Moonrise2&quot;)) + theme(legend.position = &quot;none&quot;) + labs(x = &#39;Bevel Type&#39;, y = &#39;Centroid Size&#39;) # render plot csz.bev.2 ## `stat_bindot()` using `bins = 30`.

The geomorph package uses a partial Procrustes superimposition that projects the aligned specimens into tangent space subsequent to alignment in preparation for the use of multivariate methods that assume linear space (Rohlf 1999; Slice 2001). #select landmarks from coords for blade x &lt;- c(1,7:10,4,5,15:18,19:23,26:34) # new coords midline d.blade &lt;- coords[x,,] # gpa Y.gpa &lt;- gpagen(d.blade, PrinAxes = TRUE, ProcD = TRUE, Proj = TRUE, print.progress = FALSE) # output + consensus configuration coords #Y.gpa # plot gpa results in 3D #plot(Y.gpa) # plot superimposed mshape + samples in 2D gpa.shape &lt;- Y.gpa$coords[,1:2,] plotAllSpecimens(gpa.shape, mean = TRUE) # geomorph data frame gdf &lt;- geomorph.data.frame(shape = Y.gpa$coords, size = Y.gpa$Csize, heart = qdata$heart.out, hreg = qdata$heart.reg, bev.1 = qdata$bev, bev.2 = qdata$bev.type) # render 3d gpa plot #plot(Y.gpa) # gpa plot # knitr::include_graphics(&#39;images/gpa3d.png&#39;) 4.2.1 Boxplot attributes # add centroid size to qdata qdata$csz &lt;- Y.gpa$Csize # print updated qdata with centroid size knitr::kable(qdata, align = &quot;ccccc&quot;, caption = &quot;Modified attributes included in qdata.&quot;) (#tab:box.attr.blade)Modified attributes included in qdata. heart.out heart.reg bev bev.type csz 11AI225 H H y unifacial.bimarginal 83.46349 11HE445 N P n no.bevel 95.38377 HK49_1462 N I n no.bevel 78.96266 HK49_2 N I n no.bevel 54.76663 HK49_3022 N I n no.bevel 70.45670 HK49_3823 N I n no.bevel 83.36789 HK49_4 N I n no.bevel 86.78195 HK49_5928 N I y alternate 88.68039 HK49_5961 N I n no.bevel 75.03190 HK49_7 N I y unifacial.bimarginal 76.64708 KeilMangold10 H H y alternate 95.81780 KeilMangold13 H H y alternate 107.41468 KeilMangold14 H H y alternate 113.47074 KeilMangold17 H H y alternate 76.12417 KeilMangold24 H H y alternate 74.18493 KeilMangold3 H H y alternate 90.37319 KeilMangold42 H H y alternate 81.21540 KeilMangold64 H H y alternate 110.57008 KeilMangold8 H H y alternate 73.91721 KeilMangold90 H H y alternate 84.83581 Kinzer46 N P n no.bevel 65.75985 Kinzer49 N P n no.bevel 63.19490 Kinzer50 N P y alternate 62.46276 Leprechaun11MS1983FSI800-5 H H y alternate 156.37774 MA1699p1 H H y alternate 117.26771 MA1699p3 H H n no.bevel 101.05494 McL4_158 N I y alternate 50.06683 McL4_614 N I n no.bevel 63.86622 McL7_101 N I n no.bevel 58.46574 McL7_168 N I n no.bevel 74.40636 Nochta11MS128BFSI267-1 H H y alternate 77.36259 Nochta11MS128bFSIPP1001 H H y alternate 128.70737 Nochta11MS128BFSIPP2495 H H y alternate 59.01967 Nochta11MS128BFSIPP3305 H H y alternate 39.61299 Nochta11MS12BFIS800-168 H H y alternate 81.94253 OH1_176 N I n no.bevel 62.67296 ReedVoss2 H H y alternate 86.20972 TR10_4 N I n no.bevel 47.41853 Welton1 N P n no.bevel 168.44826 Welton2 N P y alternate 97.37505 Welton4 N P y alternate 124.51238 Welton5 N P y unifacial.bimarginal 148.30370 # attributes for boxplots csz &lt;- qdata$csz # centroid size heart &lt;- qdata$heart.out # heartland in/out hreg &lt;- qdata$heart.reg # heartland region bev.1 &lt;- qdata$bev # beveled yes/no bev.2 &lt;- qdata$bev.type # type of beveling 4.3 Principal Components Analysis Principal components analysis (Jolliffe 2002) was used to visualise shape variation among the Dalton blades.

A residual randomization permutation procedure (RRPP; n = 10,000 permutations) was used for all Procrustes ANOVAs (Adams and Collyer 2015; Collyer and Adams 2018), which has higher statistical power and a greater ability to identify patterns in the data should they be present (Anderson and Ter Braak 2003). To assess whether shape changes with size (allometry), and differs by group (region), Procrustes ANOVAs (Goodall 1991) were also run that enlist effect-sizes (zscores) computed as standard deviates of the generated sampling distributions (Collyer, Sekora, and Adams 2015). knitr::include_graphics(&#39;images/dalton-vizhypothesis1.jpg&#39;) (#fig:lm3d3.a1.h1.blade)Hypothesis 1 considers whether Dalton blade shapes discovered in (left) and out (right) of the Heartland differ in morphology. 4.6.1 Boxplot (H1) # boxplot of Dalton blade centroid size by in/out heartland csz.hrt &lt;- ggplot(qdata, aes(x = heart, y = csz, color = heart)) + geom_boxplot() + geom_dotplot(binaxis = &#39;y&#39;, stackdir = &#39;center&#39;, dotsize = 0.3) + scale_colour_manual(values = wes_palette(&quot;Moonrise2&quot;)) + theme(legend.position = &quot;none&quot;) + labs(x = &#39;In Heartland?&#39;, y = &#39;Centroid Size - Blade&#39;) # render plot csz.hrt ## `stat_bindot()` using `bins = 30`.

A residual randomization permutation procedure (RRPP; n = 10,000 permutations) was used for all Procrustes ANOVAs (Adams and Collyer 2015; Collyer and Adams 2018), which has higher statistical power and a greater ability to identify patterns in the data should they be present (Anderson and Ter Braak 2003). To assess whether shape changes with size (allometry), and differs by group (region), Procrustes ANOVAs (Goodall 1991) were also run that enlist effect-sizes (zscores) computed as standard deviates of the generated sampling distributions (Collyer, Sekora, and Adams 2015). knitr::include_graphics(&#39;images/dalton-vizhypothesis4-1.jpg&#39;) (#fig:lm3d3.a1.h4.blade)Hypothesis 4 considers whether discrete beveling practices articulate with differences in the morphology of Dalton blades. 4.9.1 Boxplot (H4) # boxplot of Dalton blade centroid size by bevel type csz.bev.2 &lt;- ggplot(qdata, aes(x = bev.2, y = csz, color = bev.2)) + geom_boxplot() + geom_dotplot(binaxis = &#39;y&#39;, stackdir = &#39;center&#39;, dotsize = 0.3) + scale_colour_manual(values = wes_palette(&quot;Moonrise2&quot;)) + theme(legend.position = &quot;none&quot;) + labs(x = &#39;Bevel Type&#39;, y = &#39;Centroid Size - Blade&#39;) # render plot csz.bev.2 ## `stat_bindot()` using `bins = 30`.

The cross-section was generated using two planes; one that bisects the projectile between LMs 04 and 05 to the tip (LM 01), and the other between LM 06 at the base to the same midpoint between LMs 04 and 05. Thus, the midline does not run straight from base to tip; rather, it captures the unique geometry of each component, yielding increased precision in the analysis of dynamic midline cross-sectional morphology. 5.1 Load packages + data # load packages # devtools::install_github(&quot;geomorphR/geomorph&quot;, ref = &quot;Stable&quot;, build_vignettes = TRUE) library(here) library(geomorph) library(tidyverse) library(wesanderson) # read GM data source(&#39;readmulti.csv.R&#39;) # read .csv files setwd(&quot;./data&quot;) filelist &lt;- list.files(pattern = &quot;.csv&quot;) coords &lt;- readmulti.csv(filelist) setwd(&quot;../&quot;) # read qualitative data qdata &lt;- read.csv(&quot;qdata.csv&quot;, header = TRUE, row.names = 1) qdata &lt;- qdata[match(dimnames(coords)[[3]],rownames(qdata)),] # print qdata #knitr::kable(qdata, align = &quot;cccc&quot;, caption = &quot;Attributes included in qdata.&quot;) 5.2 Generalized Procrustes Analysis Landmark data were aligned to a global coordinate system (Kendall 1981, 1984; Slice 2001), achieved through generalized Procrustes superimposition (Rohlf and Slice 1990) performed in R 4.0.2 (R Core Development Team, 2020) using the geomorph library v. 3.3.1 (Adams et al. 2017; Adams and Otárola-Castillo 2013).

The geomorph package uses a partial Procrustes superimposition that projects the aligned specimens into tangent space subsequent to alignment in preparation for the use of multivariate methods that assume linear space (Rohlf 1999; Slice 2001). #select landmarks from coords for midline cross-section a &lt;- c(1,6,19:30) # new coords midline mid.cross &lt;- coords[a,,] # gpa Y.gpa &lt;- gpagen(mid.cross, PrinAxes = TRUE, ProcD = TRUE, Proj = TRUE, print.progress = FALSE) # output + consensus configuration coords #Y.gpa # plot gpa results in 3D #plot(Y.gpa) # plot superimposed mshape + samples in 2D gpa.shape &lt;- Y.gpa$coords[,1:2,] plotAllSpecimens(gpa.shape, mean = TRUE, label = TRUE) # geomorph data frame gdf &lt;- geomorph.data.frame(shape = Y.gpa$coords, size = Y.gpa$Csize, heart = qdata$heart.out, hreg = qdata$heart.reg, bev.1 = qdata$bev, bev.2 = qdata$bev.type) # render 3d gpa plot #plot(Y.gpa) # gpa plot # knitr::include_graphics(&#39;images/gpa3d.png&#39;) 5.2.1 Boxplot attributes # add centroid size to qdata qdata$csz &lt;- Y.gpa$Csize # print updated qdata with centroid size knitr::kable(qdata, align = &quot;ccccc&quot;, caption = &quot;Modified attributes included in qdata.&quot;) (#tab:box.attr.midcross)Modified attributes included in qdata. heart.out heart.reg bev bev.type csz 11AI225 H H y unifacial.bimarginal 61.11487 11HE445 N P n no.bevel 74.76206 HK49_1462 N I n no.bevel 62.32906 HK49_2 N I n no.bevel 43.89554 HK49_3022 N I n no.bevel 58.82286 HK49_3823 N I n no.bevel 68.88024 HK49_4 N I n no.bevel 69.37156 HK49_5928 N I y alternate 76.12177 HK49_5961 N I n no.bevel 59.22129 HK49_7 N I y unifacial.bimarginal 58.72811 KeilMangold10 H H y alternate 79.94603 KeilMangold13 H H y alternate 90.16432 KeilMangold14 H H y alternate 95.03489 KeilMangold17 H H y alternate 63.74870 KeilMangold24 H H y alternate 66.53311 KeilMangold3 H H y alternate 78.06352 KeilMangold42 H H y alternate 70.17120 KeilMangold64 H H y alternate 89.51775 KeilMangold8 H H y alternate 63.16566 KeilMangold90 H H y alternate 70.79786 Kinzer46 N P n no.bevel 49.45532 Kinzer49 N P n no.bevel 50.00941 Kinzer50 N P y alternate 50.92278 Leprechaun11MS1983FSI800-5 H H y alternate 123.57821 MA1699p1 H H y alternate 100.78437 MA1699p3 H H n no.bevel 81.08615 McL4_158 N I y alternate 41.97174 McL4_614 N I n no.bevel 58.00930 McL7_101 N I n no.bevel 48.24119 McL7_168 N I n no.bevel 60.62005 Nochta11MS128BFSI267-1 H H y alternate 64.09966 Nochta11MS128bFSIPP1001 H H y alternate 103.68372 Nochta11MS128BFSIPP2495 H H y alternate 49.42412 Nochta11MS128BFSIPP3305 H H y alternate 34.27501 Nochta11MS12BFIS800-168 H H y alternate 67.43576 OH1_176 N I n no.bevel 47.59644 ReedVoss2 H H y alternate 73.67803 TR10_4 N I n no.bevel 36.91107 Welton1 N P n no.bevel 141.06458 Welton2 N P y alternate 82.52663 Welton4 N P y alternate 104.63232 Welton5 N P y unifacial.bimarginal 121.00806 # attributes for boxplots csz &lt;- qdata$csz # centroid size heart &lt;- qdata$heart.out # heartland in/out hreg &lt;- qdata$heart.reg # heartland region bev.1 &lt;- qdata$bev # beveled yes/no bev.2 &lt;- qdata$bev.type # type of beveling 5.3 Principal Components Analysis Principal components analysis (Jolliffe 2002) was used to visualise shape variation among the bifaces.

To assess whether shape changes with size (allometry), and differs by group (region), Procrustes ANOVAs (Goodall 1991) were also run that enlist effect-sizes (zscores) computed as standard deviates of the generated sampling distributions (Collyer, Sekora, and Adams 2015). knitr::include_graphics(&#39;images/dalton-vizhypothesis2.jpg&#39;) (#fig:lm3d3.a1.h2.midcross)Hypothesis 2 considers whether Dalton points discovered in the heartland (left), interior (center), and northern periphery (right) differ in morphology. 5.7.1 Boxplot (H2) # boxplot of Dalton point centroid size by heartland + regions csz.hreg &lt;- ggplot(qdata, aes(x = hreg, y = csz, color = hreg)) + geom_boxplot() + geom_dotplot(binaxis = &#39;y&#39;, stackdir = &#39;center&#39;, dotsize = 0.3) + scale_colour_manual(values = wes_palette(&quot;Moonrise2&quot;)) + theme(legend.position = &quot;none&quot;) + labs(x = &#39;Heartland Region&#39;, y = &#39;Centroid Size - Mid Cross&#39;) # render plot csz.hreg ## `stat_bindot()` using `bins = 30`.

Procrustes superimposition translates, scales, and rotates the coordinate data to allow for comparisons among objects (Gower 1975; Rohlf and Slice 1990).
